## Introduction

[Endlessh](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/03/22/) is a great idea that not only blocks the brute force SSH attacks, but also wastes attackers time as a kind of counter-attack. Besides trapping the attackers, I also want to visualize the Geolocations and other statistics of the sources of attacks. Unfortunately the wonderful original [C implementation of endlessh](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh) only provides text based log, but I do not like the solution that writes extra scripts to parse the log outputs, then exports the results to a dashboard, because it would introduce extra layers in my current setup and it would depend on the format of the text log file rather than some structured data. Thus I create this golang implementation of endlessh to export [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics and a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard to visualize them.

If you want a dashboard of sources of attacks and do not mind the endlessh server, besides trapping the attackers, does extra things including: translating IP to Geohash, exporting Prometheus metrics, and using more memory (about 10MB), this is the solution for you.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo then build from source:

```
go build .
./endlessh-go &
```

Alternatively, you can use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/shizunge/endlessh-go):

```
docker run -d -p 2222:2222 shizunge/endlessh-go -logtostderr -v=1
```

It listens to port `2222` by default.

Then you can try to connect to the endlessh server. Your SSH client should hang there.

```
ssh -p 2222 localhost
```

If you want log like the [C implementation](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh), you need to set both CLI arguments `-logtostderr` and `-v=1`, then the log will go to stderr. You can set different log destinations via CLI arguments.

Also check out [examples](./examples/README.md) for the setup of the full stack.

## Metrics

Endlessh-go exports the following Prometheus metrics.

| Metric                               | Type  | Description  |
|--------------------------------------|-------|--------------|
| endlessh_client_open_count_total     | count | Total number of clients that tried to connect to this host. |
| endlessh_client_closed_count_total   | count | Total number of clients that stopped connecting to this host. |
| endlessh_sent_bytes_total            | count | Total bytes sent to clients that tried to connect to this host. |
| endlessh_trapped_time_seconds_total  | count | Total seconds clients spent on endlessh. |
| endlessh_client_open_count           | count | Number of connections of clients. <br> Labels: <br> <ul><li> `ip`: Remote IP of the client </li> <li> `local_port`: Local port the program listens to </li> <li> `country`: Country of the IP </li> <li> `location`: Country, Region, and City </li> <li> `geohash`: Geohash of the location </li></ul> |
| endlessh_client_trapped_time_seconds | count | Seconds a client spends on endlessh. <br> Labels: <br> <ul><li> `ip`: Remote IP of the client </li> <li> `local_port`: Local port the program listens to </li></ul> |

The metrics is off by default, you can turn it via the CLI argument `-enable_prometheus`.

AbuseIPDB reporting is also off by default, you can turn it on via the CLI argument '-enable_abuseipdb'

It listens to port `2112` and entry point is `/metrics` by default. The port and entry point can be changed via CLI arguments.

The endlessh-go server stores the geohash of attackers as a label on `endlessh_client_open_count`, which is also off by default. You can turn it on via the CLI argument `-geoip_supplier`. The endlessh-go uses service from [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/), which may enforce a query rate and limit commercial use. Visit their website for their terms and policies.

You could also use an offline GeoIP database from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com) by setting `-geoip_supplier` to _max-mind-db_ and `-max_mind_db` to the path of the database file.

The AbuseIPDB reporting requires their free to use API available at their [website](https://www.abuseipdb.com/pricing), once you have it, add it as a docker environment variable `ABUSE_IPDB_API_KEY`

## Dashboard

The dashboard requires Grafana 8.2.

You can import the dashboard from Grafana.com using ID [15156](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15156)

The dashboard visualizes data for the selected time range.

The IP addresses are clickable and link you to the [ARIN](https://www.arin.net/) database.
